iPhones and iPads are great when travelling, but the mains USB chargers with UK plugs aren't the easiest things to pack into laptop bags.  The pins on the UK mains plug are bulky and can easily damage other stuff in your bag.

I stumbled across a neat solution; a USB charger with a UK plug that has a folding earth pin.

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00E5IGR32/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00E5IGR32&linkCode=as2&tag=67616c6f6f70682e636f6d-21">{% img center /images/folding_plug_charger.jpg %}</a>

These output 2.1A, which is plenty for charging power hungry devices like the iPad.

I bought a couple, so I'll see how they perform in the field.  You can get them direct from <a href="http://www.lindy.co.uk/usb-firewire-c4/usb-mains-adapters-chargers-c240/folding-usb-uk-mains-charger-black-p7022">Lindy</a>, but they're cheaper on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00E5IGR32/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00E5IGR32&linkCode=as2&tag=67616c6f6f70682e636f6d-21">Amazon</a>.
