I've been looking for a decent sized bin for the workshop. I wanted something metal with a lid, so that I didn't have to worry about setting it on fire if I weld near it.  You'd think it'd be a common requirement, but all I could find were fancy kitchen bins or ridiculously expensive industrial pedal bins.

In the end, I found a store on eBay selling <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/251161514936?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649">205 litre tapered steel drums</a> complete with lids for Â£23.99 (even including delivery!). After adding an old door handle to the lid plus a couple of bungees to secure a bin bag, it's perfect!
