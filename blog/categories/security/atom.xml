    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a>. They&rsquo;re nice and easy to use and add an extra layer of security. We use them at <a href="http://codeenigma.com">Code Enigma</a> too, which means that I have a bunch of them for various tasks. The problem then becomes identifying which Yubikey is which.</p>

<p>I could have just used stickers, but as I carry my Yubikeys on my keychain, I didn&rsquo;t think stickers would last very well. A quick enquiry on the Yubikey forum confirmed that the keys are <a href="http://forum.yubico.com/viewtopic.php?p=7139">made from ABS</a>. I&rsquo;ve worked with ABS before and it can be easily sovent welded using acetone.</p>

<p>A cheap source of some ABS in various colours is the selection packs of filler rods used for heat welding repairs to plastic car body parts. I found a pack on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/271108796860">eBay</a>.</p>

<p>Using some acetone, I solvent welded the ABS strips onto the edge of my Yubikeys, then trimmed the strips down to size, before sanding them down flush.</p>

<p>Now, I can quickly identify which Yubikey is which, and they still stack nicely together on my keychain.</p>
